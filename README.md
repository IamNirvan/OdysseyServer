# OdysseyServer - Chat Application (server side)

## Introduction
OdysseyServer is a CLI application. The project was built out of pure curiosity, and also because it was a chance for me to familiarize myself with sockets in Java.

This program enables the host machine to act as a server by listening for incoming connections by clients, and facilitating their communication.

**Version:** 1.2.0<br>
**Implemented language:** Java.<br>
**Project status:** Not under maintenance.

The standard features include:
1. Multithreading.
1. Listening for connections.
1. Supporting multiple clients.
1. Tracking clients that are engaged in the communication.

## Technologies

## Requirements
1. Java (**Version 11.0.12 is recommended**)

## Inspiration

This project was based on a YouTube video by WittCode regarding [Java socket programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLfuZrrfKes).
